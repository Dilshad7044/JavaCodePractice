/*
   
Write a program to find out the difference between sum of all the elements in two arrays arr1 and arr2.
If sum of all elements in arr1 is larger then, the output should be First array is larger,
if sum of all elements in arr2 is larger then, the output should be Second array is larger,
otherwise the output should be Both are equal.

Input Format
First line contains n, size of the first array.

Second line contains n elements of the first array.

Third line contains m, size of the second array.

Fourth line contains m elements of the second array.

n and m will always be equal.

Output Format
Print the output as per difference.
